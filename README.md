## Brunch starter with Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.2

This is the "starter-0" code from the [brunch.io guide demos](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-guide-demos), modified to add [bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.2]() to it.

It doesn't work, yet: though its Javascript is being included in `vendor.js`, I haven't gotten sass-brunch to compile Bootstrap's `bootstrap.scss`.
